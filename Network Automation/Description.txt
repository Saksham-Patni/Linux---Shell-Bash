Consider the scenario:
======================================
An RHEL server is just handed to you after installation. It has 4 physical Ethernet interfaces. 
A data sheet is provided to you containing following parameters.
- IP addresses and other interface details
- Hostname of machine and its corresponding IP
- DNS address
- A list of hostnames and their IPS. These are the hosts with which this server might interact with.
- Sysctl parameters

============================================================================================================
Create a script which can help user configure these parameters.

Version 1.x - Basic script
--‐ Collect the data and display in tabular format first.
--‐ Get input parameter name and its value from user.
--‐ Update the configuration.
--‐ Create a data file for RHEL/CentOS which contains the absolute path of configuration files. This data file should be used instead of hard-coding paths inside the script itself.
Version 2.x
--‐ Collect the data and group them so that it is easy for user to find a configuration. For example,
o interfaces (containing all interface configuration)
o DNS (containing hostname, nameserver, domain related config)
o sysctl (containing all sysctl parameters)
--‐ User is shown a menu which group names. User selects the group and then all configuration parameters in each group is listed.
--‐ User can updated the desired parameter just the way in version 1.x
--‐ Use a data file as described for 1.x
Version 3.x
--‐ All points in version 2.x
--‐ Add switches i.e. arguments to the script as given in the man page sample given at the end of this document.
--‐ Add logging of configuration changes with timestamp.
Version 4.x
--‐ All points in 3.x
--‐ Add a mechanism which can detect Linux distro and configures the corresponding files in that Linux distro.
--‐ This will need a data file containing network configuration path of various Linux distros.
--‐ Include Linux distro name in logs generated by script.
===================================================================================================================

NOTE: There should be no redundant configuration parameters. For example, hostname of machine and its corresponding IP is given.
- All types of invalid entry should be handled
- No input from user shouldn’t erase the old value
- Wrong parameter names
- Wrong parameter values (like "1234/xyz" input for IP)
- Syntax error in input should be handled.
